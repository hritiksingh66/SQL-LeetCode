## 🧠 About SQL

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is used to manage and query relational databases. It's widely used in data analysis, backend development, and data engineering. These problems cover a wide range of SQL topics, such as:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc.
- Table joins: `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
- Subqueries and nested queries
- `UNION`, `EXISTS`, `IN`
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, etc.
- CTEs (`WITH` clauses)
